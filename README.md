# Javascript Concepts

As a web engineer, I use javascript almost daily.

_But do I really know it_?

I am writing these docs as a teaching aid for myself, as a way to reenforce specific concepts that I've more or less been ignorant to, minus just knowing the correct pattern of keystrokes to type to make something work.

This will also serve as proof to my future senile self that at one point in my life I grasped some Javascript concepts.
